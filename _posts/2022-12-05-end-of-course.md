And that brings us to the end, of ST 558: Statistics for Data Science. The course was undoubtedly one of my favourites in the program. Although not exhaustive, it is a pretty air-tight course for anyone trying to dive into Data Science and R Programming for the first time. It is a good balance between theoretical and hands-on material, introducing you to the best practices of programming and teaching you the application of the different methodologies in data science. Towards the end of it, not only would you know how to recognize the machine learning models that would fit your dataset but know how to get the model deployed too! 

Reflecting back, I had always considered Python programming as my strength in Data Science. However, I can now add R programming to that list. Building a UI/UX using Shiny was new and exciting. Henceforth, I will make it a point to deploy and create a User Interface for every project that I build. I am impressed with the pretty plots that R can create with just the ggplot library in comparison to its competitors(yes, I am looking at you Python!). I enjoyed the component of utilizing Github and creating blog posts. Over the years, I have worked on multiple projects but failed to maintain a consistent Github repo or create a portfolio. I am going to spend my Winter break displaying my accomplishments embellished on a portfolio and adding my projects to the GitHub repository. The green dots indicating your activity on GitHub is such an absolute delight to look at and extremely satisfying! Lastly, the course has introduced me to an enormous resource goldmine. Apart from the crisp and concise lecture slides, here are some of the resources that you bet are currently bookmarked on my browser : 

1. [Github](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) Integration with R
2. Amazing online book for learning [R](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
3. All-time favourite book for a quick read or a thorough understanding of a [Data Science topic](https://www.statlearning.com/)
4. All-time favourite book for a quick read or a thorough understanding of a [Data Science topic(Advance)](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)
5. Everything you need to know in [`caret`](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)
6. Build aesthetic applications with [Shiny](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/)
7. If this is the first time you have heard the term ["docker"](https://docker-curriculum.com/)

Once I graduate, I strive to work as a Data Scientist at a Pharmaceutical organization. I seek opportunities that are well-balanced in programming and analysis. My quest for learning and enforcing topics in data science and machine learning focusing on statistical tools and techniques continues. I wish to expand my knowledge in the implementation of regression and classification models, longitudinal data analysis, causal data analysis, and non-parametric data analysis.
