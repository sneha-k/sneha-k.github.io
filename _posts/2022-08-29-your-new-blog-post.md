# Battle of a Data Scientist vs Statistician 

## Introduction
While you must have heard the term "Statistician" if you have been around since the 20th century, "Data Scientist" is definitely a newer position in the industry. My strong believe is that although being a "Data Scientist" is like being the cool kid on the block, there is tons of confusion in what a Data Scientist actually does. Let us look at two job postings to make a point here.

Both these jobs were advertised as "Data Scientists" and yet they have such diverse responsibilities and this is a common trend across industries. 

## What is then the role of a data scientist?
A role of a data scientist can be thought of as cross-functional â€” needing to know both technical skills and soft-skills of the business. A data scientist is required to have core knowledge on the collection, preparation, analysis, management, visualization, and storage of large volumes of information. Having a strong understanding of software engineering, data modelling and deployment is important. A major responsibility of a data scientist is to build robust models for predictive analysis. This process involves, building multiple models and comparing their accuracy to find the model that best suits the dataset. 

## So how are statisticians any different?
Statisticians take a somewhat different approach in model building. Instead of building complicated models, a statistician focuses on fitting a simple model to the data, checking if the assumptions satisfy, reiterating the process by addressing the violated assumptions and the process is marked complete once the model is fit with all the assumptions satisfied. A statistician focusses on dealing with the uncertainty that exists in a data and hence the corressponding model. A statistician might focus more on the relationship and the uncertainity in the relationship between the predictor and the target variable as comapred to the data scientist. A data scientist may be more qualified to model big data that can't be handled by a single computer and requires paralel processing. The end-goal of statistical analysis is often to draw a conclusion about the inference and relationship, based on the quantification of uncertainty. By contrast, the end-goal of data science analysis is more often to do with a specific database or predictive model. Although, we could tear apart the differences of a data scientist and a statistician to the core, the reality is that there exists a huge overlap between the two areas. A data scientist requires a core understanding of statistical concepts and with the dynamic team engagement and ever growing data, it is required for a stistician to understand working and processing big data. 

## Conclusion
An age old description of a data scientist was "Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.". Although absurd, I find myself in a perfect juncture between a data scientist and a statistician. With a technical undergraduate degree and an ongoing Master of Statistics, I would call myself a Data Scientist with a strong acumen in decision-making based on statistical analysis.
