# Battle of a Data Scientist vs Statistician 

## Introduction
While you must have heard the term "Statistician" if you have been around since the 20th century, "Data Scientist" is a newer position in the industry. My strong belief is that although being a "Data Scientist" is like being the cool kid on the block, there is tons of confusion about what a Data Scientist does. Let us look at two job postings to make a point here.

Both these jobs advertised as "Data Scientists", yet they have diverse responsibilities. This disparity is a common trend across industries. 

## What is then the role of a data scientist?
A data scientist's role can be thought of as cross-functional â€” needing to know both technical and soft skills of the business. A data scientist is required to have core knowledge of the collection, preparation, analysis, management, visualization, and storage of large volumes of information. Strong understanding of software engineering, data modelling, and deployment is important. A major responsibility of a data scientist is to build robust models for predictive analysis. This process involves, building multiple models and comparing their accuracy to find the model that best suits the dataset. 

## So how are statisticians any different?
Statisticians take a somewhat different approach to model building. Instead of building complicated models, a statistician focuses on fitting a simple model to the data, checking if the assumptions satisfy, reiterating the process by addressing the violated assumptions, and the process is marked complete once the model is fitted with all the assumptions satisfied. A statistician focuses on dealing with the uncertainty that exists in data and hence the corresponding model. A statistician's focus is more on the relationship and the uncertainty in this relationship between the predictor and the target variable. A data scientist may be more qualified to model big data that can't be handled by a single computer and requires parallel processing. The end goal of statistical analysis is often to draw a conclusion about the inference and relationship, based on the quantification of uncertainty. By contrast, the end goal of data science analysis is more often to do with a specific database or predictive model. Although we could tear apart the differences between a data scientist and a statistician to the core, the reality is that there exists a massive overlap between the two areas. A data scientist requires a core understanding of statistical concepts, and with the ever-growing data, it is required for a statistician to understand working and processing big data. 

## Conclusion
An age-old description of a data scientist was "Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.". Although absurd, I find myself in a perfect juncture between a data scientist and a statistician. With a technical undergraduate degree and an ongoing Master of Statistics, I would call myself a Data Scientist with a strong acumen in decision-making based on statistical analysis.
