The purpose of this blog is to capture my learnings from **ST 558 : Statistics for Data Science**. This coursework is an elective in my Master of Statistics program. 

## About the Blog 
ST 558 walks through methods for reading, manipulating, and combining data sources including databases. Custom functions, visualizations, and summaries. It deals with common analyses done by data scientists and discusses methods for communicating results including dashboards. The libraries that we will explore in R Programming inclide but are not limited to, `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, `ggplot2`, `knitr`, and `shiny`.

The primary purpose of this blog is to capture the blog submissions for the coursework. The schedule for it is as such :
 
* First Blogpost - 08/29
* Second Blogpost - 09/15
* Third Blogpost - 10/17
